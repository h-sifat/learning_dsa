# Hash Table / Dictionary

## What are Hash Tables?

From Wikipedia: A hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that
implements an associative array or dictionary. It is an abstract data type that
maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also
called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired
value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash
indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

### Operations

1. Insert: O(1)
1. Lookup: O(1)
1. Delete: O(1)

**Note:** In the worst case scenario these operations may run in O(n) time
complexity.
